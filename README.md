## Data Structure and Algorithms in Python

1. Stack
    - Determine if brackets are balanced
    - Reversed string
    - Convert decimal integer to binary 

2. Singly Linked Lists
    - Insertion
    - Deletion by value
    - Deletion by position
    - Length
    - Node swap
    - Reverse
    - Merge two sorted linked lists
    - Remove duplicates
    - Nth-to-last node
    - Count occurences
    - Rotate
    - Is palindrome
    - Move tail to head
    - Sum two linked lists

3. Circular Linked Lists
    - Insertion
    - Remove node
    - Split linked lists into two halves
    - Josephus problem
    - Is circular linked lists

4. Doubly Linked Lists
    - Append and prepend
    - Add node before/after
    - Delete node
    - Reverse
    - Remove duplicates
    - Pairs with sums

5. Arrays
    - Array Advance Game
    - Arbitrary precision increment
    - Two sum problem
    - Optimal task sssignment
    - Intersection of two sorted arrays
    - Buy and sell stock

6. Binary Trees
    - Traversal algorithm
    - Level-order traversal
    - Reverse level-order traversal
    - Calculate binary tree height
    - Calculate tree size

7. Binary Search Trees
    - Insertion and search
    - Check BST property

8. Binary Search
    - Find the closest number
    - Find fixed point
    - Find bitonic peak
    - Find first entry in list with duplicates
    - Bisect method
    - Integer square root
    - Cyclically shifted array

9. Recursion
    - Find uppercase letter in string
    - Calculate string length
    - Count consonants in string
    - Product of teo positive integers

10. String Processing
    - Look-and-say sequence
    - Spreadsheet encoding
    - Is palindrome
    - Is anagram
    - Is palindrome permutation
    - Check permutation
    - Is unique
    - String to integer
